# Your favorite news platform or youtube channel doesn't have a comments section?
SavAct's comments section is a way out.

## Immutable comment section for all websites
This smart contract allows comments to be linked to web pages. The comments are immutable stored on blockchain.

## Current Features
- No need of further RAM for each new comment.
- The first 12 characters of a domain are used as scope. 
- Conversion of all allowed characters in ACE strings to base 40 numbers to wrap them in one uint64_t type.
- The beginning characters "https://", "http://", "www." and "m." of links are not distinguished.
- The primary key is generated by a hash to distribute entries evenly.

## Note
This smart contract is work in progress.

### TODO:
- Store an entry ACTION.
- Count payments as likes or dislikes.
- Send payment amounts of dislikes to token owners.
- Send payment amounts of likes to creators.
